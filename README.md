# 🌍 Travel AI Agent – IBM Cloud Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is the final submission for the internship program offered by **IBM SkillsBuild** and the **Edunet Foundation**, under the **AI & Cloud Technologies track**. The objective was to build an intelligent **Travel AI Agent** capable of assisting users in planning their travel efficiently by leveraging **AI, cloud computing**, and **natural language capabilities**. The solution addresses the problem of fragmented travel information, overwhelming options, and lack of personalized planning tools.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s travel landscape, users are overwhelmed with scattered information across various platforms when trying to plan a trip. The challenge was to design and implement an AI-based travel assistant that:

* Understands user queries in natural language
* Recommends destinations, itineraries, accommodations, and activities
* Provides real-time, context-aware suggestions
* Learns and adapts based on user preferences and external data (e.g., weather, events)

The solution must use IBM's AI and cloud services, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Solution: Travel AI Agent

The **Travel AI Agent** developed in this project is a cloud-based intelligent assistant built using IBM technologies. It interacts with users via natural language, retrieves relevant travel data, and generates personalized responses using advanced AI models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### ☁️ IBM Cloud Lite Services

* Cloud infrastructure to deploy and host the Travel AI Agent
* Ensures scalable, secure, and efficient application performance

### 🤖 IBM Watsonx.ai Studio

* Used to train, evaluate, and deploy AI models
* Offers a collaborative platform for building and managing AI workflows

### 🔁 IBM Watsonx.ai Agentic Framework (Agentic AI)

* Enables modular, goal-driven agents
* Used to structure the Travel AI Agent into distinct reasoning and execution modules (e.g., query understanding, data retrieval, itinerary generation)

### 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Enhances the AI's knowledge with dynamic information retrieval
* Used for fetching relevant travel content, real-time data, and enriching responses

### 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Allows the system to understand and process user inputs
* Powers the chatbot interface for query interpretation and intent extraction

### 🧱 IBM Granite Foundation Model

* Foundation model powering the NLP and generative layers of the agent
* Capable of producing coherent, relevant, and context-aware travel suggestions

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User submits a natural language query (e.g., "Plan a 5-day trip to Himachal in winter").
2. The NLP module interprets the query and extracts intent, location, duration, and preferences.
3. The RAG system fetches relevant travel content, real-time data, and recommendations.
4. The Granite model generates a structured response, suggesting a travel plan.
5. The user receives an interactive response via the frontend or CLI interface.

## 🧪 Evaluation

* Functionality tested across various user scenarios and travel goals
* Accuracy evaluated based on relevance, personalization, and response time
* Deployment verified on IBM Cloud Lite with consistent uptime and responsiveness
